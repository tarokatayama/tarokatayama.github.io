title: "[Waterville: Fast Food Capital of the United States?](https://storymaps.arcgis.com/stories/8902d7ea4fd34bf3b7079dd8e9df9931)"
excerpt: "A silly project that looked at the number of fast food restuarants in Waterville, ME and verified an urban legend of the town- that Waterville was the Fast Food Capital of the United States (most fast food restuarants per capita). This project utilized jupyter notebook, ArcGIS online storymaps & dashboard. <br/><img src='https://scottperryphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/1246A029-0CED-487F-A217-451F89F3188E.jpeg'>"
