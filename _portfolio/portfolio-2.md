## Project Background

This investigation began as a curiosity-driven project to verify a local urban legend in Waterville, Maine. Using geospatial analysis tools, I examined the density of fast food establishments relative to population size to determine if the town truly deserved its unofficial title as the "Fast Food Capital of the United States."

### Technical Approach:
- Data collection and cleaning using Python in Jupyter Notebooks
- Spatial analysis of restaurant density patterns
- Population-based statistical comparisons with national averages
- Creation of an engaging, interactive narrative using ArcGIS StoryMaps
