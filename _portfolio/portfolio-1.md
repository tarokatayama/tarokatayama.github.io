## Project Overview

This analysis was the cornerstone of my Master's Project at Duke University, focusing on the water-energy nexus within electric vehicle production. The project evaluated the water footprint of mineral extraction for EV batteries, identifying critical regions where mining operations intersect with water scarcity issues.

### Key Components:
- Development of comprehensive water scarcity maps using ArcGIS Pro
- Creation of an interactive dashboard for visualizing high-risk mining operations
- Analysis of water usage patterns across different mineral extraction processes
- Recommendations for sustainable water management in battery supply chains
