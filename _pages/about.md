Hi there, I am a recent graduate from Duke University's Nicholas School of the Environment, where I studied Water Resources Management. I am incredibly interested and fascinated in water related issues, particularily those surrounding water rights, water scarcity, and how these issues are complicated further by climate change. At school, I developed an interest in data science, and enjoy the creative nature of programming. I hope to continue my journey
