# About

I'm an environmental scientist specializing in water resource management, with expertise in geospatial analysis, data visualization, and scientific monitoring. Currently working as a Biologist at Cabrillo National Monument, I leverage my skills in GIS, R programming, and creative science communication to lead multiple natural resource monitoring programs. My experience ranges from analyzing water footprints of electric car batteries to designing fog monitoring systems in drought-prone climates. With a Master's in Environmental Management from Duke University and a background in wetland restoration and conservation, I'm passionate about addressing water resource challenges through innovative, data-driven approaches.
